# Trivivia

This is a web application for desktop and mobile to create and run real time "Geeks Who Drink"-like trivia quizzes.  An example of such a quiz can be found on the [GeeksWhoDrink Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@geekswhodrink)

This application is deployed at [https://trivivia.twilightparadox.com](https://trivivia.twilightparadox.com)

## Does the quiz update in real time?

Yes!  When running a quiz, the quiz admin can hide or show questions and answers, grade contestants/teams, and keep track of the score all in the application.  This information is all updated in real time without requiring participants to refresh.

## Do users need an account to play a quiz I've made?

No.  Once you have signed up, created, and started a quiz, users can visit a simple url or snap a QR code to join the quiz you are running.

## What kind of quiz does this support?

This application is primarily designed to create and run quizzes with 7-8 rounds of 8-9 questions, with ~20 teams/contestants at a time.  It supports variable numbers of rounds and questions, but going really far beyond what it was designed for might cause some problems.

The creation of a quiz requires user signup.  This gives you access to a quiz admin panel where you can create and run quizzes.

When creating a quiz, use the interface to create rounds and questions in each round.  Supported question types are
  - single answer
